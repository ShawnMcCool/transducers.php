* Renamed `transducers\seq()` to `transducers\xform()`.
* Renamed `transducers\vec()` to `transducers\to_traversable()`.
* Renamed `transducers\is_iterable()` to `transducers\is_traversable()`.
* Added `transducers\to_fn()` so that transducers can be used with existing
  reduce functions like `array_reduce`.
